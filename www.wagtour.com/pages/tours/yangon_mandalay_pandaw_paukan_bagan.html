title:Beautiful Bagan Tour 

city: Bagan

description: Bagan is located on a wide plain east of the Ayeyarwaddy River in Central Myanmar and is home to more then 2000 temples and pagoda, dating back over 1000 years. | Bagan took form as the capital of a Burmese kingdom during its heyday form the 11th to 13th centuries AD.  Staying in the ancient town and spending time around the famous temples and peaceful surrounds will fill you with some of the most memorable moments and spectacular sights you’ll ever experience. | Our Bagan Day Tour will fill you with wonder as you walk amongst thousands of years of history. | 1. Visit to famous Nyaung U market.  Visitors can find beautiful lacquerware or buy seasonal fruits and foods.  You can mingle with locals in the market too while observing the daily lifestyle of locals. | 2.  Next we will go to the famous Shwezigon Pagoda, near the town of Nyaung U. This pagoda houses the 170-foot-high Ananda Temple, which shelters four revered standing Buddha statues. | 3.  Continue to the famous pagoda That Byinnyu, the tallest monument in Bagan, and Gawdawpalin the second tallest temple in Bagan. | 4.  Lunch at Green Elephant Restaurant which overlooks the mighty Ayeyarwaddy River. | 5.  Visit the Mahabodhi Paya. Unlike any other Bagan temple, this monument, located on the north side of the main road 380yd west of the Tharabar Gate, is modeled after the famous Mahabodhi temple in Bodhgaya, India. The temple commemorates the spot where the Buddha attained enlightenment. Built during the reign of Nantaungmya in 1215, the temple’s unusual pyramidal spire is richly coated in niches enclosing seated Buddha figures, rising from a square block. The stairway to the top is closed. Inside is a modern makeover – with tile floor and carpet. The ruined buildings just north feature some original glazed painting fragments. | 6.  Largest of all the temples in Bagan, the Dhammayan Gyi  as it is popularly known was built during the reign of King Narathu (1167-1170). Narathu, who came to the throne by assassinating his father Alaungsithu and his elder brother, presumably built this largest temple to atone for his sins. | 7.  Visit to Shwegugyi. Built by Alaungsithu in 1131, this smaller but elegant pahto, 220yd north of Thatbyinnyu, is an example of Bagan’s middle period of temple-building, marked by a transition in architectural style from the dark and cloistered to the airy and light. Shwegugyi means “Great Golden Cave” and its corncob sikhara is a scaled-down version of the one at Ananda. | 8.  Visit to Everstand Lacquere Ware workshop to study the process of making lacquerware. | 9.   Visit to the Shwesandaw Paya, Bagan’s most famous sunset-viewing spot. The Shwesandaw is a graceful white pyramid-style pagoda with steps leading past five terraces to the circular stupa top, with good 360-degree views. | 10.  Dinner at Sunset restaurant facing the magnificent Ayeyarwaddy River.
