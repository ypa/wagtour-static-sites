title:Absolutely Beautiful Inlay

city: Inlay

description: INLE LAKE is 13.5 miles long and 7 miles wide. Up close, it’s hard to tell where the lake finishes and the marshes start. | Looking down over the lake from the Taunggyi road, Inle lies in an enormous carpet of greenery. Dotted around the lake are the stilt-house villages and floating gardens of the Intha tribe. The Intha technique of leg rowing – where one leg is wrapped around the paddle to drive the blade through the water in a snake-like motion – is unique. | With our Inle Lake Day tour, you will experience a unique way of life that has lived on through generations, whilst exploring the culturally significant surrounds that form part of this beautiful region of Myanmar. | 1.  Sightseeing around the Inle Lake. You will be provided with a life jacket and easy seat for each person on the boat.  This early morning tour offers magnificent scenery and the chance to observe the daily life of locals, who are mostly fishermen and plantation farmers.  Take good photos of leg rowers of Intha (people from Inlay), situated only in this part of the world. Tomatoes and other vegetable plantation will catch your eye. | 2.  Breakfast at the Hotel. | 3.  Visit to the Phaung Daw Oo, the four revered golden Buddha images from the pagoda, which are ferried around the lake in a gilded barge shaped like a Hintha (the golden swan of Burmese legend) visiting all the pagodas in the area. | 4.  Continue visit the Nga Hpe Kyaung (Jumping Cat Monastery) where cats are trained to jump like in circus shows. | 5.  Lunch at local restaurant. | 6.  Visit to the Indein where you can see more of 8th Century ancient pagodas at Indein. | 7.  Visit to the Silver Smith Shops, Silk Weaving Workshops and the Lotus Weaving Workshop; all unique features of Inle Lake. | 8.  Dinner at a local floating restaurant, which will give you a magnificent view and taste of Intha cuisine. | 9.  Overnight at the Hotel.
