title:Fantastic Yangon Day Tour

city: Yangon

description: Yangon is the gateway though which most foreign tourists enter Myanmar, the biggest urban area in the country. Myanmar’s biggest city and former capital, Yangon is comparatively young. It became the capital only in 1885, when the British completed their conquest of northern Myanmar. | Yangon remains Myanmar’s unofficial capital, full of history and important religious sites. And now you are about to start your Unforgettable Experience of Myanmar with our private Yangon day tour. Here’s what you can look forward to: | 1. Visit to the magnificent Shwedagon Pagoda. | Among Yangon’s biggest attractions are its numerous, Buddhist shrines, the most famous and spectacular of which is Shwedagon Pagoda. This 98-metre-high golden stupa, located at the top of Singuttara Hill, can be seen from anywhere in the city, towering above the hectic  urban landscape  like a glowing beacon of peace and serenity. The pagoda platform holds a dazzling array of shrines where devotees gather to meditate, make offerings, meet friends and share food. It is a vibrant, life–affirming atmosphere where visitors can experience firsthand the essence of Buddhist culture in Myanmar. | 2. Visit to the Chaukhatgyi reclining Buddha image. | Statues of the Buddha reclining represent one of the four postures for meditation as taught by the Buddha. Chaukhatgyi’s reclining Buddha image is 75m long. It is also one of Myanmar’s more beautiful reclining Buddha. | 3. The next location we will visit is  Kandawgyi Lake. | Literally translated as ‘Royal Lake’, this natural lake close to the city centre is a good place for a stroll. The lake is most attractive at sunset, when the glittering Shwedagon is reflected in its calm water. Take your time to explore from the Lake’s eastern edge. | 4. Lunch at “Feel Traditional Myanmar Restaurant” where you can taste and enjoy authentic dishes of famous Myanmar cuisine. | 5. After lunch, we’ll spend the afternoon sightseeing around the downtown area. Yangon is a unique city in South East Asia owing to its many impressive examples of architecture dating back to the British Colonial era. These include City Hall, High Court, Inland Water Transport (previously owned by Irrawaddy Flotilla Company), and the sprawling Secretariat building, where General Aung San, Myanmar’s hero of independence and father to Aung San Suu Kyi, was assassinated on July 19, 1947. | 6. High tea at the impressive Strand Hotel, a colonial building that is over 100 years old. Having a cup of coffee or tea at the Strand Hotel during your visit offers a refreshing yet majestic pause during your unforgettable trip to Myanmar. | 7.  Visit to China Town. Yangon boasts a longstanding multicultural population. This cultural diversity is reflected in the wide range of cuisine available in the city, from traditional Burmese curries: to ethnic foods from Myanmar’s border areas such as Shan and Kachin States: to Asian favorites from China, India and Thailand; to gourmet from as far away as France and Italy. China Town features streetside dining and interesting shopping for just about anything you can imagine! | 8. Dinner at a local restaurant. | 9. Overnight at the hotel.
